        The point of framing social interaction through the analogy of battling Shadows in the Metaverse is to change the cognition of the user to view social interaction as something fun like a game rather than something scary or intimidating. 
        This rewires the approach of the user to improve at the ‘game’, thus reaping social growth and drastically reducing friction towards difficult social initations.\n""")

        When you enter a battle (social interaction) with a Shadow (person), the objective is to lower the Shadow's HP through your battle options with the option to hit their weaknesses to the point where it can trigger a Hold Up. 
        During a Hold Up, you can choose to enter a negotiation, return to battle, or perform an All-Out Attack.
