# Update 2026:
# Note:
# Need to write to files, don't append. 
# For example, if you want to register a Lvl 18 Arsene when your previous Arsene was Lvl 10, you would have to 
# overwrite the Lvl 10 Arsene to register it. This would require the write paramater for the mode instead of append
# requirements:
# Get user input and store it


# Store Personas as Objects
