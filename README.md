(WIP)

Welcome to the Metaverse Social System! This is a personal project that I created during the summer of 2025, in which I wanted to create a way of improving my social 
skills in a way that would make it easier for me to understand hidden social dynamics. 

In general, I learned a lot of elaborate social techniques due to researching videos on social skills and charisma in the past, but a problem I experienced was forgetting to use them in the heat of social interactions under pressure. 

I took one of my favorite JRPGs and games of all time, Persona 5, and translated it's combat system into social interaction, making social interaction a fun game with rewards for improving your skills and a constant sense of novelty while improving real-life professional and personal skills.
